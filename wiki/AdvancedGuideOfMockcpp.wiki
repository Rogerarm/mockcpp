==1. Default behavior==

Default behavior is specified by _*defaults()*_, instead of _*expects()/stubs()*_. Relations between _*defaults()*_ and _*expects()/stubs()*_ could be thought as relations between *default* and *case* in C/C++ *switch* sentences. If all mock specifications of a method of a mock object specified with _*expects()/stubs()*_ don't match one of your invocations to the method in question, the specification defined with _*defaults()*_ (if have any) will be used to perform the return behavior. 

This is a very useful feature. It helps you write your tests in a neater way.
